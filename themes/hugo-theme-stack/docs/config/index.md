# Introduction

Hugo acepts `TOML`, `YAML` and `JSON` as configuration formats. This theme currently uses `YAML` and `TOML` as configuration formats. 

::: info
In the foreseeable future, this theme will migrate all its configurations to `TOML` format. 
:::

If you are using `hugo-theme-stack-starter` template, you can find the configuration file under `config/_default/` folder, separated in different major sections to make it easier to find the configuration you want to modify.

A full list of available configurations can be found in `config.yaml` file located in the root directory of this theme. (If it is not there, please send an issue to let me know.)

There are plenty tools that converts `YAML` to `TOML` and vice versa. You can use them to convert the configuration file to the format you prefer.
