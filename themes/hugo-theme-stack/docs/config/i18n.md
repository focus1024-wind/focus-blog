# i18n

Hugo has built-in support for multilingual sites. You can find more information about it in the [official documentation](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/).

Translation files are placed in the `i18n` directory. The file name is the language code. For example, the `en.yaml` file is the translation file for English.

In order to use a language, set `DefaultContentLanguage` to the language code in the configuration file. For example, if you want to use English, set `DefaultContentLanguage` to `en`.

Currently, the theme supports the following languages:

* `ar`: Arabic
* `bn`: Bengali
* `ca`: Catalan
* `de`: German
* `el`: Greek
* `en`: English
* `es`: Spanish
* `fa`: Persian
* `fr`: French
* `hu`: Hungarian
* `id`: Indonesian
* `it`: Italian
* `ja`: Japanese
* `ko`: Korean
* `nl`: Dutch
* `pl`: Polish
* `pt-br`: Portuguese
* `ru`: Russian
* `th`: Thai
* `tr`: Turkish
* `uk`: Ukrainian
* `zh-cn`: Chinese (Simplified)
* `zh-hk`: Chinese (Traditional) (Hong Kong)
* `zh-tw`: Chinese (Traditional) (Taiwan)
